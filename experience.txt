<p align="center"><font size="6">Firstly, experience can be defined as the process of getting knowledge or skill from doing, seeing, or feeling things.
<p align="center"><font size="6">I have lived for 20 years. There are a lot of experience that I have faced. There are both good and bad experience. These experiences teaches me to become more obedient and a better person than yesterday. One of the experience that I learned is that I learned life need sacrifice to create a better future. This can be proven when I moved to Tanjung Malim and left my beloved homentown, Kuala Kangsar. But, I learned that from leaving our old place, we can explore more in this world and see something we never see before. From moving, I go to know new places, people, friends. 
<br>
<p align="center"><font size="6">Apart from that, experience that I faced teaches me how to learn better for my academic. I learned how to write better in essay, talk better in public. Until today, I have confident to talk to public adn speak about certain topic that will interest people.
